# Real EgyptAir Personnel Names from OM-A

## Extracted from Operations Manual Part A (OM-A)

### Senior Management / Board

1. **CAPT. YASSER HUSSIN** - Accountable Manager
2. **CAPT. MOHAMED MERSAL** - Senior Position
3. **CAPT. MOHAMED ELYAN** - Senior Position  
4. **CAPT. SHERIF ARRAM** - Senior Position
5. **F/O AHMED FARID** - First Officer

### Usage in System

These are the real names found in the OM-A document. We should use these names for:

- Chief Pilots (use Captain names)
- Board members
- Senior management positions
- Example pilot names in rosters

### Proposed Mapping

**Chief Pilots (6 aircraft types):**
- A320: CAPT. YASSER HUSSIN
- A330: CAPT. MOHAMED MERSAL  
- A350: CAPT. MOHAMED ELYAN
- B737: CAPT. SHERIF ARRAM
- B777: CAPT. [Need more names from OM-A]
- B787: CAPT. [Need more names from OM-A]

**Note:** The OM-A document has limited captain names visible. We may need to:
1. Use the available names for the main chief pilots
2. Keep some realistic Egyptian names for the remaining positions
3. Ensure all names sound authentic and professional
